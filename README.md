🎭 Emotion Detection Model

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to recognize human facial emotions in real time.
The model detects emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more using a webcam feed.
It combines OpenCV for face detection and a deep learning CNN for emotion classification.
